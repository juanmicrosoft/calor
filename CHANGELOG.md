## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`calor fix --elide-call-closers` bulk migrator (CLI + SDK).** New `calor fix` subcommand that rewrites existing `.calr` source trees to the v0.6.x call-closer-elided form: zero-arg `§C{X} §/C` → `§C{X}` and same-line one-arg `§C{X} §A arg §/C` → `§C{X} arg`. Multi-line forms, named-arg (`§A[name] x`), multi-arg, and `ref`/`out`/`in` arg modifiers are left untouched. Computes token-precise byte spans on the original source and records them as `{file, byte_offset, byte_length, removed_bytes_base64}` entries (shape shared with `StructuralIdDropper.LogEntry`) so `--revert --log <file>` restores byte-for-byte. Includes a canonical-emit safety net (re-parse the migrated source, re-emit both ASTs through `CalorEmitter`, drop the file's edits on any divergence) that catches semantics-changing edits (e.g. a trailing `§+ y` sibling that would be absorbed into the call's arg expression). Mutually exclusive with `--drop-structural-ids` and `--compact-ids`; supports `--dry-run` and `--log`. Implementation: `src/Calor.Compiler/Migration/CallCloserElider.cs`. Tests: 12 cases in `tests/Calor.Compiler.Tests/Migration/CallCloserEliderTests.cs` (zero-/one-/multi-arg, named args, nested, multi-line skip, round-trip byte equality, idempotence, lex-error skip). Closes the v0.6.3 item from `docs/plans/v0.6-call-closer-elision.md` §2.3 ("No new migrator (yet)").
- **LSP quick-fixes for strict bind-inference diagnostics `Calor0251`/`Calor0252`/`Calor0253`.** Each diagnostic now ships a `SuggestedFix` that inserts the recommended `:type` annotation right before the closing `}` of the bind's attribute block. Concrete templates: `:Option<object>` (for `§NN`), `:object?` (for `null`), `:Vec<object>` / `:Map<object, object>` / etc. arity-aware per the matched generic factory, and `:f64` (for ambiguous numeric). Surfaces in any IDE talking to `calor-lsp` via the existing `CodeActionHandler` and in the CLI's existing fix-application paths. Closes #644. Only fires on canonical bind shapes (`§B{name}` / `§B{~name}`) so the edit placement is provably correct.
- **`Calor.LanguageServer.DocumentState.Reanalyze` now runs `BindValidationPass`** so strict-bind diagnostics (and their quick-fixes) surface in editors; previously the LSP only ran the lexer/parser/binder and these diagnostics were CLI-only.

### Changed
- **Expression-context `§C` calls now elide `§/C` by default for one-argument forms.** `CalorEmitter.Visit(CallExpressionNode)` extends the v0.6.1 zero-arg elision and the v0.6.2 stmt-context one-arg elision to expression context: `§C{target} arg` (no `§A`, no `§/C`) when the argument is unnamed, the rendered first token is in the `StartsWithExpressionStarter` whitelist, and we are not inside an inline-sibling context. Conversion scorecard: 96/100 → 99/100 round-trip pass (+3 net, 0 regressions). RFC: `docs/plans/v0.6-call-closer-elision.md` §2.1/§2.2/§8.1.
- **Strict bind-inference diagnostics `Calor0251`/`Calor0252`/`Calor0253` are now default-on** (RFC v0.6 bind-inference-formalization §6 Phase 4). These flag bindings that cannot infer a concrete type without an explicit `:type` annotation: untyped `§NN`/`null`, well-known generic factory calls (`Vec.empty`, `List.empty`, etc.), and binary ops mixing integer and floating-point literals. Audit across `samples/` and `tests/TestData/Benchmarks/` (230 files): zero firings — the corpus is already strict-clean. Opt out for one release with `--no-strict-bind-inference` (CLI) or `CompilationOptions.StrictBindInference = false` (SDK). The `--strict-bind-inference` flag continues to be accepted for backward compatibility.

### Fixed
- **Parser: `Calor0150` no longer fires across sibling-statement boundaries.** When the next expression-start token after a one-arg elided call is on a different line, it is a sibling statement, not an ambiguous second positional arg. Previously the parser misclassified patterns like `§B{p} §C{f} §IDX{a} i` followed on the next line by `§IF p ...` as a second arg, raising a spurious Calor0150. Now gated by a same-line check at `Parser.cs ~7992`. Regression test: `ExpressionContext_OneArgFollowedBySiblingStatement_NoCalor0150`.
- **Emitter: `§LAM` body, `§WITH` target, and `§LIST`/`§HSET` element emit sites now use `AcceptInInlineSibling`.** These same-line sibling positions previously used raw `node.X.Accept(this)`, which could silently corrupt the AST after the one-arg expression-context elision landed. Guarded by the existing `CalorEmitter_HasNoRawAcceptInSpaceSeparatedSiblingPosition` static test.

### Internal
- **In-repo `.calr` corpus migrated to the elided form** by running `calor fix --elide-call-closers` against `samples/` and `tests/TestData/Benchmarks/`: 9 files changed, 92 elisions total (40 in `samples/`, 52 in `tests/TestData/Benchmarks/`), 0 regressions. `samples/TypeSystem/typesystem.calr` was skipped automatically by the migrator's canonical-emit safety net (it uses an older `() -> void` signature shape that does not survive re-parse after elision) — left untouched, still parses, still compiles.
- Closed stale PRs #559, #619, #625 (superseded by later work).
- Updated four conversion snapshots (`tests/Calor.Conversion.Tests/Snapshots/{05-01,05-02,05-03,12-02}.approved.calr`) for the mechanical `§A arg §/C` → `arg` shape change.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-10

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.29x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 1.86x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.84)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.51x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.25)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.38x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=7.10)
  - EditPrecision: 1.36x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=4.85)
  - Correctness: 1.30x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.37)
  - TokenEconomics: 1.12x ± 0.00 (Calor wins)
  - GenerationAccuracy: 1.02x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, marginal)
  - InformationDensity: 0.99x ± 0.00 (C# wins, small effect d=-0.47)
- **Programs Tested**: 210 (was 207 in v0.6.1 — three new TokenEconomics fixtures exercising statement-context call elision: `VoidSequence`, `LogPipeline`, `PairLogger`)

### Added
- **Elision-aware TokenEconomics benchmark fixtures.** Three new programs (`VoidSequence`, `LogPipeline`, `PairLogger`) added to `tests/TestData/Benchmarks/TokenEconomics/` to exercise the new statement-context `§/C` elision path. Two are favorable to Calor (zero-arg and one-arg call sequences); `PairLogger` is a neutral control using multi-arg calls where elision does not apply. See PR #653 for the bias analysis.

### Changed
- **Statement-context `§C` calls now elide `§/C` by default (when safe).** `CalorEmitter.Visit(CallStatementNode)` rewrites zero-argument calls as `§C{target}` and one-argument unnamed calls (with safe-prefix arguments) as `§C{target} arg`, matching the v0.6.1 behavior for expression-context calls. Elision is gated by `UseImplicitCallCloser` and is suppressed inside inline-sibling contexts (e.g. short lambda bodies) to avoid AST corruption. RFC: `docs/plans/v0.6-call-closer-elision.md` §3.2/§4. See PR #652.

### Removed
- **`calor diagnose` CLI command removed.** The command was deprecated in v0.5.x (PR #609) with a removal target of v0.6.0; this release completes that deprecation. For machine-readable diagnostics use the `calor_check` MCP tool with `action: "diagnose"` (or `calor_compile` with automatic fix application). Documentation pages and cross-links have been removed.

### Fixed
- **Contract verifier: class methods, user-defined types, and visibility preservation.** `ContractSimplificationPass` now preserves the `Visibility` of class methods so the contract verifier can be reached for `§MT` members. `ContractVerificationPass` extended to walk class-method bodies. The Z3 contract translator gained support for user-defined types and dot-path field access (`a.b.c`). PR #618.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-09

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.29x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 1.85x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.84)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.52x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.26)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.38x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=7.10)
  - EditPrecision: 1.36x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=4.83)
  - Correctness: 1.31x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.40)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Changed
- **`ConversionContext.UseImplicitCallCloser` now defaults to `true`** (was `false` in v0.6.0). The C# → Calor converter (`CalorEmitter.Visit(CallExpressionNode)`) now elides `§/C` for zero-argument calls by default, producing more idiomatic Calor output. The opt-out (`UseImplicitCallCloser = false`) is preserved and tested (`CallExpressionImplicitCloseTests.Emitter_ZeroArgCall_ImplicitCloserFlagFalse_PinsExplicitCloser`). One-argument elision remains intentionally deferred — see `docs/plans/v0.6-call-closer-elision.md` §2.2.

### Fixed
- **Parser: `§C` standard form no longer swallows trailing `Dedent`.** `Parser.ParseCallExpression` previously routed zero-arg calls (followed by `Dedent`) into the standard-form branch (which calls `ExpectBlockEnd(EndCall)`), and `ExpectBlockEnd` consumed the `Dedent` thinking it was an indent-only block terminator. Because `§C` is an inline expression (not an indent-aware block), this corrupted the structural parse of the enclosing method/if body. Fixed by changing the implicit-close gating predicate from `!IsBlockEnd(EndCall)` (which is `true` on Dedent/Eof) to `!Check(EndCall)`. Regression test: `Emitter_ZeroArgCall_AsLastStatementBeforeDedent_RoundTripsCorrectly`.
- **Parser: `§C` no longer absorbs a same-column sibling structural opener on the next line.** Because `IsExpressionStart()` returns `true` for `§IF`/`§MATCH`/`§NEW`/etc., a sibling opener immediately following a zero-arg `§C` (same column) was being absorbed as the call's inline argument. Fixed in both `ParseCallExpression` and `ParseCallStatement` by gating the inline-arg branch on `Current.Span.Line == startToken.Span.Line` — the inline-arg form only triggers when the candidate argument is on the same source line as `§C{target}`. Regression test: `Emitter_ZeroArgCall_FollowedBySiblingOpener_RoundTripsCorrectly`.
- **Parser: `§C` expression form now refuses implicit-close when the next `§A` is on the same line.** `ParseCallExpression`'s implicit-close branch previously allowed `Check(Arg) == true` to be treated as "no more args" whenever any `§A` was visible, including a same-line `§A` that genuinely belonged to *this* call. Now the inline branch only triggers when the next `§A` (if any) is on a different line — preventing the parser from prematurely returning a zero-arg call when more inline `§A`s follow on the same line (matters for `§BASE`/`§THIS` constructor initializers spread across multiple lines).
- **Parser: `§C` statement form supports zero-arg implicit close before sibling statements.** Previously `ParseCallStatement` fell through to the standard-form branch (which required `§/C`/Dedent/Eof) when a sibling statement followed a zero-arg `§C{target}` on the next line at the same indent, reporting `Calor0100`. The statement-form parser now recognizes a zero-arg implicit close when the current token is not `§A`, `§/C`, `Dedent`, or `Eof`.
- **Emitter: zero-arg `§C` inside an inline-sibling context now keeps explicit `§/C`.** With the new default (`UseImplicitCallCloser = true`), naively eliding `§/C` from a zero-arg call emitted inside another call's `§A` chain or inside any space-separated sibling position caused **silent AST corruption**: e.g. `M(A(), 2)` round-tripped as `M(A(2))`, and `new[] { A(), B() }` round-tripped as a single element `A(B())`. `CalorEmitter` now tracks an `_inInlineSiblingContext` counter via the `AcceptInInlineSibling` helper; zero-arg `§/C` elision is suppressed whenever the counter is non-zero. The helper is applied at every emit site producing two or more expressions on a single line: `§A` args of calls (`§C`/`§NEW`/`§BASE`/`§THIS`), `§KV` key+value of dict entries (`§DICT` body, `DictionaryNode`, standalone `KeyValuePairNode`), `§PUT`/`§SETIDX`/`§INS`/`§IDX` collection ops, Lisp-form binary ops (`(op a b)`), null-coalesce (`(?? a b)`), inline conditional (`(? c t f)` and `§IF` form), forall/exists/implication bodies, and `STR_OP`/`CHAR_OP`/`SB_OP` arg lists. Top-level / leaf-position calls (binding initializers, return values, etc.) still elide as before. Regression tests: `Emitter_ZeroArgCallAsArgInMultiArgCall_KeepsExplicitCloser`, `Emitter_AdjacentZeroArgCallsInArrayInitializer_KeepsExplicitClosers`, `Emitter_ZeroArgCallAsTopLevelExpression_StillElidesCloser`, plus 6 coverage tests pinning §NEW args, §BASE/§THIS args, §KV, §PUT, §SETIDX, §INS, §IDX, Lisp binary-op, null-coalesce, conditional, and forall/exists/implication bodies.

### Compatibility
- **Calor source emitted by v0.6.1 may not parse on v0.6.0 or earlier `calor` toolchains.** The new default emits more zero-arg `§C` calls without explicit `§/C`. While the v0.6.0 parser nominally accepts the implicit-close form, the two parser fixes above (`Dedent` swallowing and same-column sibling absorption) only ship in v0.6.1 — sources that exercise those layouts will mis-parse on v0.6.0. To produce v0.6.0-compatible output from v0.6.1, use any of:
  - **CLI single-file:** `calor convert --explicit-call-closers <input.cs>`
  - **CLI project migration:** `calor migrate --explicit-call-closers <path>`
  - **MCP `calor_convert` / `calor_migrate`:** `"explicitCallClosers": true`
  - **SDK:** `new ConversionOptions { UseImplicitCallCloser = false }`

  Note: round-trip (`C# → Calor → C#`) remains semantic/structural; the intermediate `.calr` is intentionally *not* byte-identical to v0.6.0 converter output unless the opt-out is used.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-04

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.29x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 1.85x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.84)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.52x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.26)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.38x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=7.10)
  - EditPrecision: 1.36x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=4.83)
  - Correctness: 1.31x ± 0.00 (Calor wins, large effect d=1.40)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

Per-program metrics are unchanged from v0.5.1 — the v0.6 token-economics features (compact IDs, `§C` call-closer elision, formalized `§B` inference) shrink agent-facing serialisations and tighten the binder/parser surface, but the benchmark corpus uses test IDs and explicit `§/C` forms by design, so the headline numbers are stable.

### Added
- **`§C` call-closer elision (RFC `v0.6-call-closer-elision`).** Expression-context `§C{target}` calls may now omit the trailing `§/C` in two cases: (1) zero arguments — `§B{n} §C{items.Count}` is equivalent to `§B{n} §C{items.Count} §/C`; (2) exactly one inline argument (no `§A`) — `§B{y} §C{Math.Abs} x` is equivalent to `§B{y} §C{Math.Abs} §A x §/C`. The parser disambiguates nested elided calls (e.g., `§C{Foo.bar} §C{Baz.qux} y` ≡ `Foo.bar(Baz.qux(y))`) by counting consecutive `§/C` closers relative to enclosing `§A` depth (`Parser._inOuterCallArgDepth`, bumped in `ParseCallStatement`, the expression-target-call branch, and the standard `§A`-loop branch). Trailing member access on inline arguments binds to the argument (`§C{Identity} obj?.Length` ≡ `Identity(obj?.Length)`); trailing member access on zero-arg calls binds to the call result (`§C{Maybe}?.Length` ≡ `Maybe()?.Length`). The explicit form continues to parse unchanged. See [Calls reference](/syntax-reference/calls/) and `tests/Calor.Compiler.Tests/CallExpressionImplicitCloseTests.cs` (24 tests pinning every RFC §3.2 case).
- **`Calor0150 AmbiguousCallContinuation`** — New diagnostic in the reserved `Calor0150-0159` range. Fires when an elided `§C` already consumed one inline argument and is followed by either (a) a second expression-start token (literal, identifier, nested `§C`, `§NEW`, …) or (b) a `§A` token (signalling a mixed inline/explicit form). The fix message recommends the explicit `§C{target} §A a §A b §/C` form.
- **`ConversionContext.UseImplicitCallCloser` emitter flag.** New opt-in property on `Migration/ConversionContext`. When `true`, `CalorEmitter.Visit(CallExpressionNode)` elides `§/C` for zero-argument calls. Default `false` for v0.6.0 backward compatibility. One-argument elision is intentionally deferred to v0.6.1 — flipping it on inside Lisp argument lists (`(+ §C{f} a §C{g} b)`) currently triggers `Calor0150` and requires context-aware tracking before it can be safely enabled.
- **`docs/syntax-reference/calls.md` and `website/content/syntax-reference/calls.mdx`** — Full user-facing reference for both call forms, covering all three disambiguation cases (A: trailing member on inline arg; B: ambiguous continuation / Calor0150; C: nested implicit-close calls), plus statement-context, expression-context (zero-arg, one-arg, multi-arg), and trailing member access examples.
- **`§B` bind-inference formalization (RFC `v0.6-bind-inference-formalization`).** The four supported `§B` forms — `§B{name}` (requires initializer), `§B{name} initializer` (inferred, immutable), `§B{name:type}` (explicit, no initializer), `§B{name:type} initializer` (explicit wins) — and the binder's shallow inference rule (bound type = `initializer.TypeName`, with `INT`/`STRING`/`BOOL`/`FLOAT` mapping to user-facing `i32`/`str`/`bool`/`f64`) are now documented in `docs/syntax-reference/binding.md` and `website/content/syntax-reference/binding.mdx`, with a per-initializer-shape inference table pinned by `tests/Calor.Semantics.Tests/BindInferenceDocsTests.cs`.
- **`Calor0250 BindRequiresTypeOrInitializer`** — `§B{name}` with no `:type` annotation **and** no initializer is now a hard error. Replaces the pre-v0.6 silent fallback that bound `x` as `INT` and produced wrong-typed C# with no diagnostic. Wired into the `calor compile` pipeline through `BindValidationPass` so the diagnostic carries proper span info and is reported once per offending binding.
- **`Calor0251` / `Calor0252` / `Calor0253` strict-mode bind-inference diagnostics (opt-in via `--strict-bind-inference`).** Three new diagnostics in the `Calor0250-0259` range, each silenced by an explicit `:type` annotation, scheduled to become default-on in v0.7 per RFC §6:
  - **`Calor0251 BindCannotInferNullLiteral`** — fires on `§B{x} §NN` or `§B{x} null` (untyped null literal). Suggested fix: add an `Option<T>` annotation.
  - **`Calor0252 BindCannotInferGenericReturn`** — fires on `§B{x} §C{Vec.empty} §/C` and other well-known generic factory targets (`Vec.empty`, `List.empty`, `Array.empty`, `Set.empty`, `Map.empty`). Suggested fix: add the collection's element-type annotation.
  - **`Calor0253 BindAmbiguousNumeric`** — fires on `§B{x} (+ INT:0 FLOAT:0.0)` — a binary op mixing integer and floating-point literal operands. Suggested fix: annotate with the intended result type.
- **`docs/syntax-reference/binding.md` and `website/content/syntax-reference/binding.mdx`** — New syntax-reference pages with all 4 `§B` forms, inference table, examples, round-trip behavior, and the full Calor0250–0253 diagnostic catalogue.
- **`docs/plans/v0.6-call-closer-elision.md` and `docs/plans/v0.6-bind-inference-formalization.md`** — Token-economics RFCs covering both v0.6 features (motivation, syntax, disambiguation rules, implementation plan, strict-mode rollout schedule).
- **v6 compact stable identifiers (default).** `IdGenerator.Generate(IdKind)` now mints 12-char Crockford-lowercase compact IDs (`f_7k9m2npqrstv`) per [v6 implementation plan](docs/plans/path-2-drop-ids-v6-implementation.md) and v5 RFC §16.F. The legacy 26-char Crockford-uppercase ULID form (`f_01J5X7K9M2NPQRSTABWXYZ12`) remains accepted by the parser, validator, and migration tooling, and is still produced by the new `IdGenerator.GenerateUlid(IdKind)` / `GenerateUlidWithPrefix` entry points. Saves ~9.7 tokens per ID in agent-facing serialisations.
- **`calor fix --compact-ids <root>`** — bulk repo-wide migrator from legacy ULID payloads to v6 compact payloads. Two-pass design with deterministic compact derivation (last 12 chars of the ULID payload lowercased), within-file and cross-file collision detection (re-mints fresh compact IDs on collision), and byte-exact revert via `--revert --log <file>`. Only rewrites payloads inside whitelisted ID-bearing section markers (`§M`, `§F`, `§AF`, `§L`, `§IF`, `§TR`, `§CL`, `§IFACE`, `§MT`, `§CTOR`, `§EN`, `§EXT`, `§RTYPE`, `§PROOF`, `§ITYPE`, `§IXER`, `§OP`, and their closers); ULID-shaped strings in comments, prose, or string literals are left untouched. Idempotent on already-migrated source.
- **`src/Calor.Compiler/Ids/CompactIdGenerator.cs`** — public generator for v6 compact IDs. Exposes `Alphabet` constant (`0123456789abcdefghjkmnpqrstvwxyz` — Crockford lowercase, excludes `i/l/o/u`), `PayloadLength = 12`, `GeneratePayload()`, `Generate(IdKind)`, `GenerateWithPrefix(string)`, `DeriveFromUlid(string)`, and `IsValidPayload(string)`. Uses `RandomNumberGenerator.Fill` + `byte & 0x1F` (no modulo bias).
- **`IdValidator` accepts both compact and legacy ULID forms.** New predicates `IsCompactId`, `IsLegacyUlidId`, and `IsCanonicalId` (union of the two for back-compat). New constant `IdValidator.CompactLength = 12`. New `Calor0821 LegacyUlidPayload` diagnostic code reserved for the opt-in lint that flags ULID payloads (the lint emits a fix-it patch pointing at `calor fix --compact-ids`).
- **`IdGenerator` prefix coverage extended to all 14 `IdKind` values.** Adds constants `EnumExtensionPrefix = "ext_"`, `RefinementTypePrefix = "rt_"`, `ProofObligationPrefix = "po_"`, `IndexedTypePrefix = "it_"`, `IndexerPrefix = "ix_"`. `GetPrefix` and `GetKindFromId` switches now exhaustively cover `EnumExtension`, `RefinementType`, `ProofObligation`, `IndexedType`, and `Indexer` — previously `IdAssigner.Generate(IdKind.EnumExtension)` would have thrown `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` at runtime. New `IdGenerator.ExtractPayload(string)` is format-aware (returns the payload regardless of whether it's a 12-char compact or 26-char ULID); `IdGenerator.ExtractUlid(string)` is retained but now returns `null` for compact payloads.
- **47 new tests across the v0.6 surface.** `tests/Calor.Compiler.Tests/CallExpressionImplicitCloseTests.cs` (24 tests pinning every RFC §3.2 case for call-closer elision), `tests/Calor.Compiler.Tests/Migration/CompactIdMigratorTests.cs` (23 tests covering single-ID rewrite, extra positionals preserved, closing-tag rewrite, untouched-compact, untouched-name, per-file collision, cross-file collision, existing-compact collision, byte-exact round-trip, idempotency, no-rewrite-outside-section-markers, determinism, parser-validation), plus expanded coverage in `tests/Calor.Ids.Tests/IdGeneratorTests.cs`, `tests/Calor.Semantics.Tests/BindInferenceDocsTests.cs`, and `tests/Calor.Compiler.Tests/CallStatementImplicitCloseTests.cs`.
- **`docs/ids.md` §3.1 / §3.3 / §8.3 / §10.2** and **`docs/philosophy/stable-identifiers.md`** updated to document the dual ID format, the new CLI command, and the compact-form properties.

### Changed
- **`Migration/CalorEmitter.Visit(CallExpressionNode)`** — Zero-argument calls in expression context now conditionally elide `§/C` when `ConversionContext.UseImplicitCallCloser` is `true`. The multi-argument and one-argument paths are unchanged in v0.6.0; the multi-argument path always emits `§/C`, and the one-argument path is pinned by tests as unchanged (zero-arg-only elision) pending the v0.6.1 context-aware enablement.

### Fixed
- **Binder no longer silently defaults `§B{x}` to `INT`.** A `§B{name}` with neither a `:type` annotation nor an initializer expression was silently treated as `INT` by the pre-v0.6 binder, producing wrong-typed C# with no diagnostic. v0.6 surfaces this as `Calor0250 BindRequiresTypeOrInitializer` through `BindValidationPass`. Existing well-formed code (which always carried either an annotation or an initializer) is unaffected.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-03

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.29x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 1.85x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.84)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.52x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.26)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.38x (Calor wins, large effect d=7.10)
  - EditPrecision: 1.36x (Calor wins, large effect d=4.83)
  - Correctness: 1.31x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.40)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Phase 4c PR-4 — Parser strict-mode rejection of legacy structural closers.** A new opt-in `Parser` constructor (`new Parser(tokens, diagnostics, rejectLegacyClosers: true)`) escalates the previous opt-in lint `Calor0830 LegacyCloserForm` to a parser-level error at every site that would otherwise silently consume a legacy structural closing tag (`§/M`, `§/F`, `§/AF`, `§/MT`, `§/SW`/`§/W`, `§/L`, `§/WH`, `§/I`, `§/EACH`, `§/EACHKV`, `§/IFACE`, `§/CL`). Closers that still carry payload (`§/DO` condition, `§/PP` condition, `§/K` case delimiter) and inline expression closers (`§/C`, `§/T`, `§/NEW`, `§/A`, `§/THIS`, `§/BASE`, `§/INIT`, `§/LIST`, `§/DICT`, `§/HSET`, `§/ARR`, `§/LAM`, …) are intentionally NOT rejected.
- **`calor --input … --output … --allow-legacy-closers`** — Escape hatch on the CLI compile path for users mid-migration. By default the CLI compile path is now strict (`RejectLegacyClosers = true` on the options the CLI builds) and any closer-form input source produces `Calor0830` errors. `calor format` rewrites a file in canonical indent form. Other API surfaces (`Program.Compile(source, path, options)` callers, the MSBuild `<CompileCalor>` task, MCP tools, LSP, lint/format/convert/migration tooling) keep the lax default (`RejectLegacyClosers = false`) so existing callers see no behavior change while the cross-surface migration completes.
- **`CompilationOptions.RejectLegacyClosers`** — New opt-in property on `CompilationOptions` that the CLI compile handler sets to `!allowLegacyClosers`. Defaults to `false` to preserve backward compatibility for API consumers.
- **`tests/Calor.Compiler.Tests/ParserLegacyCloserRejectionTests.cs`** — 4 new tests covering: strict mode + indent form = clean, strict mode + legacy closers = `Calor0830`, lax mode + legacy closers = silent, strict mode + retained `§/DO` payload closer = silent.

### Changed
- **`tests/Calor.Compiler.Tests/CliMultiFileTests.cs`** — The three CLI fixtures (`MultiFile_CrossModuleEffect_Violation_Errors`, `MultiFile_CrossModuleEffect_Declared_Succeeds`, `MultiFile_OutputFlag_RejectedForMultipleInputs`) now use indent form so they continue to compile cleanly through the strict CLI compile path. Function bodies were re-indented (`§F` now sits at column 2 inside its parent `§M` at column 0, and child statements at column 4) and the trailing `§/F{…}` / `§/M{…}` closer lines were removed.

### Phase 4c PR-3 (continued)

### Changed
- **Phase 4c PR-3 — Benchmark metric calculators score indent form, not closer tags.** The four heuristic calculators under `tests/Calor.Evaluation/Metrics/` used to award credit for the presence of paired structural closing tags (`§/F{…}`, `§/M{…}`, …) as a proxy for "scope boundaries are explicit". With indent form now canonical, the dedent IS the scope boundary signal, so those bonuses now award credit for the presence of at least one indented body line per structural opener instead. Net score magnitude is preserved (`+0.05 closing-tag + 0.05 matched-pair + 0.05 completeness` → `+0.10 indented-body proportional + 0.05 indent-form completeness` in `ComprehensionCalculator`; equivalent rewrites in `EditPrecisionCalculator.EstimateCollateralRisk` / `CalculateCalorEditPrecision`, in all four boundary checks in `RefactoringStabilityCalculator.CalculateStructuralClarityScore`, and in the `InformationDensityCalculator` documentation comment). Detail keys reported in `GetCalorClarityFactors` were also renamed (`closingTagCount` → `indentedBodyLineCount`, `hasMatchedPairs` → `hasIndentedFunctionBody`) so dashboards reflect the new scoring substrate. Benchmark methodology documents under `docs/benchmarking/` (and the mirror MDX docs under `website/content/benchmarking/`) were updated to match. Closes the "scoring debt" entry logged from Phase 5. All 6,919 tests still green.

### Added
- **Phase 4b PR-2 — Inline-`§NEW` arguments preserved in calls.** `Migration/CalorEmitter.Visit(CallStatementNode)` previously hoisted every argument that contained any `§` marker into a temporary `§B{~_hoist000}` binding before the call, on the (overly defensive) assumption that nested section markers would confuse the parser. The Calor parser already balances nested `§NEW{…}§/NEW` and `§C{…}§/C` correctly (`Parser.HasEndNewBeforeEndCall`), so the only case that genuinely cannot be inlined is the multi-line object-initializer form (`§NEW{T}\n  Prop = val\n§/NEW`). The hoist condition is now narrowed to "argument string contains a newline" — inline forms like `§A §NEW{StringBuilder} §/NEW` and `§A §C{Foo.Bar} §/C` are emitted directly. The held-out `tests/E2E/scenarios/09_codegen_bugfixes/input.calr` fixture (which pinned the `Console.WriteLine(new StringBuilder(), new StringBuilder())` codegen path) has been re-migrated to indent form; its `output.g.cs` golden is byte-identical to the prior emission (modulo line endings).

### Phase 4b PR-1 (continued)

### Added
- **Phase 4b — `CalorFormatter` collapsed into a thin adapter over `Migration/CalorEmitter`.** The 1,004-line hand-written formatter at `src/Calor.Compiler/Formatting/CalorFormatter.cs` (which still emitted closer form, legacy visibility shorthand `pri`, legacy range operator `..`, and the legacy `with { … }` expression syntax) has been replaced by a ~110-line adapter that delegates to `new CalorEmitter().Emit(module)` and then post-processes the result to abbreviate IDs in tags (`m001 → m1`, `for1 → l1`, `if1 → i1`, `while1 → w1`, `do1 → d1`) so `calor format` matches the canonical migration emitter byte-for-byte except for IDs. As a result the `calor format` command, the `calor lint --fix` flow, and the `format` / `check` MCP tools all now produce indent form with consistent visibility (`priv`), range (`§RANGE start end`), with-expression (`§WITH target … §/WITH`), and class declaration order (visibility before modifiers).
- **`Calor0830 LegacyCloserForm`** — Opt-in lint that flags legacy structural closing tags (`§/M`, `§/F`, `§/AF`, `§/MT`, `§/AMT`, `§/CL`, `§/IFACE`, `§/EN`, `§/L`, `§/WH`, `§/I`, `§/TR`, `§/EACH`, `§/EACHKV`, `§/USE`, `§/UNSAFE`, `§/CHECKED`, `§/UNCHECKED`, `§/PROP`, `§/CTOR`, `§/OP`, `§/IXER`, `§/W`, `§/SW`) in source that has otherwise adopted indent form. The recommended machine fix is to run `calor format`. Closers that still carry payload (`§/DO` condition, `§/PP` condition, `§/K` case delimiter) and inline expression closers (`§/C`, `§/T`, `§/NEW`, collection-literal closers, etc.) are intentionally not flagged. Source-level scanner under `Analysis/LegacyCloserFormLint.cs`; tests at `tests/Calor.Compiler.Tests/Analysis/LegacyCloserFormLintTests.cs`.

### Fixed
- **`Migration/CalorEmitter.Visit(CatchClauseNode)`** — Catch filters now emit `§WHEN` (matching the token form the parser produces, and matching the `§WHEN` already emitted by `Visit(MatchCaseNode)` for match-arm guards). Previously emitted a bare `WHEN` keyword that, while accepted by the parser as a lowercase legacy converter quirk, did not round-trip cleanly when the input already used `§WHEN`.

### Phase 4 (continued)

### Added
- **Phase 4 — Bulk fixture migration to indent form.** All Calor `.calr` fixtures across the repository (samples, scripts, `tests/TestData/`, `tests/E2E/scenarios/`, `tests/Calor.Enforcement.Tests/Scenarios/`, and the embedded `src/Calor.Compiler/Resources/SelfTest/` self-test resources) have been rewritten in indent form. 408 tracked `.calr` files migrated via a new one-off harness (`tools/Calor.IndentMigrator/`) that round-trips each file through `Migration/CalorEmitter`. Inline closers that still carry semantic payload (`§/C` on call expressions, `§/NEW` on object creation, `§/T` / `§/THIS` / `§/BASE` / `§/INIT` on initializer chains, `§/DO` / `§/PP` / `§/K` for closer-form items deferred to Phase 4b) are retained where they appear inline. The `09_codegen_bugfixes` self-test scenario is deliberately kept in closer form because it pins the inline-`§NEW`-as-call-argument codegen path that the migration emitter currently lowers via a temporary `§B{~_hoist000}` binding.
- **Migration `CalorEmitter` fixes uncovered by the Phase 4 sweep:**
  - `§Q` / `§S` contract messages are now emitted in brace form (`§Q{"msg"} (cond)` / `§S{"msg"} (cond)`) so they round-trip cleanly through `Parser.ParseRequires` / `ParseEnsures`, which read the message from the `_pos0` attribute. The previous trailing-string form was non-parsable.
  - `INT[bits=N][signed=B]` types now compact back to the short aliases (`u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64`/`i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64`) before being emitted in the compact `(TYPE:name)` parameter syntax, via a new `CompactCanonicalIntAliases` regex pass in `TypeMapper.CSharpToCalor`. The bracketed canonical form cannot be re-parsed in that position, so emitting it produced unparsable output.
  - **`MatchExpressionNode` as a `§B` binding initializer** now emits the `§W{id:expr} target` header inline with `§B{name}` and writes case arms via `AppendLine` + `Indent` / `Dedent` so they respect the binding's current indent. Previously `Visit(MatchExpressionNode)` returned a multi-line string with hardcoded 2/4-space indents that got jammed onto the `§B` line, so the §K arms below ended up at absolute columns 2/4 — not relative to the enclosing block — triggering a Calor0099 dedent error on the very next arm whenever the binding lived inside a function body indented 5+ spaces. The fix adds a dedicated `MatchExpressionNode` branch to `Visit(BindStatementNode)` (mirroring the existing collection-initializer special cases) and a shared `EmitMatchExpressionAsBindingInitializer` helper. `samples/PatternMatching/matching.calr` (5 distinct match-expression bindings, including `§PREL` arms, literal arms, `§VAR` + `§WHEN` guards, and deep alternation) re-migrated cleanly as a result.
- **`tools/Calor.IndentMigrator/`** — One-off in-place migration harness used to bulk-rewrite `.calr` fixtures during Phase 4. Walks a directory **or a single file**, round-trips each `.calr` through the migration `CalorEmitter`, and writes the result back atomically. Skips files with lex/parse errors, normalizes line endings for comparison, and is idempotent under repeat sweeps. Supports `--dry-run`, `--verbose` / `-v`, and `--exclude <path>` (repeatable) so files known to pin closer-form codegen paths can be carved out. README at `tools/Calor.IndentMigrator/README.md`.

### Changed
- **Lint no longer flags leading indentation or blank lines.** With indent form now canonical, the two formatting lint rules introduced for the closer-form "agent-optimized" surface — "Line has leading whitespace (indentation not allowed)" and "Blank lines not allowed in agent-optimized format" — have been removed from both `Commands/LintCommand.cs` and `Mcp/Tools/CheckTool.cs`. The corresponding `LintRegressionTests.cs` cases have been inverted to assert that indentation and blank lines are accepted, and `Lint_IdAbbreviation_DetectsExpectedIssues` counts were halved to reflect that each block ID now appears once (on the opener) rather than twice (opener + closer).

### Added
- **Phase 3 — `CalorEmitter` emits indent form.** The C#→Calor migration emitter no longer emits structural closing tags (`§/M{…}`, `§/F{…}`, `§/CL{…}`, `§/MT{…}`, `§/L{…}`, `§/IF{…}`, `§/TR{…}`, `§/USE{…}`, `§/EACH{…}`, `§/EACHKV{…}`, `§/WH{…}`, `§/W{…}`, `§/ARR{…}`, `§/ARR2D{…}`, `§/UNSAFE{…}`, `§/SYNC{…}`, `§/FIXED{…}`, `§/EN{…}`, `§/EEXT{…}`, `§/DEL{…}`, `§/EVT{…}`, `§/EADD`, `§/EREM`, `§/GET`, `§/SET`, `§/INIT`, `§/CTOR{…}`, `§/IFACE{…}`, `§/PROP{…}`, `§/IXER{…}`, `§/OP{…}`, `§/DECISION{…}`, block-form `§/LIST{…}` / `§/DICT{…}` / `§/HSET{…}`) when converting C# to Calor. Block ends are now expressed purely through dedent, matching the canonical indent-only surface taught in [Phase 5 docs](/docs/) and accepted by the parser since [Phase 1](/docs/syntax-reference/structure-tags/). 165 conversion snapshots regenerated. Three closer forms are intentionally retained for follow-up design work: `§/DO{id} condition` (do-while carries the loop condition on its closer), `§/PP{COND}` (preprocessor blocks echo the condition for chained `#if/#else` readability), and `§/K` (match-case body delimiter).
- **Phase 3 parser hardening** — Class / interface members with empty bodies (constructors, methods, async methods, interface method signatures, properties, indexers, operator overloads, events) now terminate cleanly in indent form via a new `IsClassMemberOpener` / `TryExpectMemberBlockEnd(hasBodyContent)` helper pair. The `hasBodyContent` flag prevents the empty-body member from greedily consuming a dedent that actually belongs to the enclosing class / interface. `ParsePreprocessorDirective` now calls `ConsumeDedentBeforeChain(§PPE, §/PP)` so chained `#if / #else / #endif` blocks parse correctly when the if-branch had indented body content. `TestHelpers.CompileCalorToCSharp` in `Calor.Conversion.Tests` was migrated to `Lexer.TokenizeAllForParser()` to match the production CLI path; 118 previously-failing round-trip tests now pass (Conversion.Tests 280/280).
- **`Optional closing-tag IDs`** — Structural closing tags (`§/M`, `§/F`, `§/AF`, `§/L`, `§/I`, `§/TR`, `§/CL`, `§/IN`, `§/PR`, `§/MT`) may now omit the trailing `{id}` block. Both forms are accepted side-by-side; the parser pairs closers with their nearest matching opener by structural nesting. Openers continue to carry IDs as before.
- **`calor fix --drop-structural-ids <root>`** — Bulk, mechanical, byte-reversible source rewriter that strips `{id}` from structural closing tags (and the leading `{id:…}` from openers when the rest can be preserved). Records every removal in a `migration.log.json` and supports `--revert --log <file>` to restore the original bytes exactly. Only touches values that look like production IDs (`prefix_payload` with a 12-char compact or 26-char ULID payload); short test IDs like `m001` are left alone. See [`docs/cli/fix.md`](docs/cli/fix.md).
- **`Calor0820 LegacyStructuralId`** — Opt-in lint that flags closing tags still carrying a production-ID payload, with a `fix` patch that points at `calor fix --drop-structural-ids`.
- **`BytePreservationVerifier`** — Migration utility that verifies a rewrite plus its revert reproduces the original file byte-for-byte. Used by the integration tests for `calor fix`.

### Changed
- **`CalorEmitter` block-end emission flows through `EmitBlockEnd(legacyCloser)` helper** — single chokepoint for the closer-vs-indent decision. The `legacyCloser` parameter is preserved at every call site so a future opt-in flag (or migration-mode emitter) can restore explicit closers without re-touching every visit method.

### Documentation
- New: `docs/cli/fix.md`.
- Updated: `docs/syntax-reference/structure-tags.md`, `docs/syntax-reference/index.md`, `docs/ids.md`, `docs/cli/index.md` reflect the optional closing-tag ID and the new `calor fix` command.
- **Phase 5 — Product docs migrated to indent-only syntax.** README, `docs/`, and `website/content/` now teach indent-form Calor as the canonical surface; closer-form (`§/F{id}`, `§/M{id}`, etc.) is mentioned only in legacy callouts that point at `calor fix` for migration. Touched 87 markdown/MDX files via `scripts/phase5_migrate_docs.py` (962 fenced code blocks scanned, 452 transformed, 46 MDX brace-corruption sites repaired) plus surgical hand-edits of prose sections (Quick Reference tables, Closing-Tag rows in control-flow / structure-tags, "Use closing tags" agent guidance in Claude / Codex / Gemini integration pages, Principles tables in philosophy docs). The 6 `tests/E2E/agent-tasks/fixtures/refactor-*-calor/CLAUDE.md` agent-prompt fixtures were also rewritten so the safe-refactoring benchmark teaches indent form when it next runs in CI.

### Known scoring debt (follow-up after Phase 4)
- The static heuristic metric calculators in `tests/Calor.Evaluation/Metrics/` (`ComprehensionCalculator`, `EditPrecisionCalculator`, `InformationDensityCalculator`, `RefactoringStabilityCalculator`) still reward closer-tag presence directly (e.g., `source.Contains("§/F{")` ⇒ +0.05). After Phase 4 subtractively removes closer-form support, these calculators (and their methodology / metric docs in `docs/benchmarking/` and `website/content/benchmarking/`) must be updated to score indent-form structure instead. The **agent-refactoring** benchmark is unaffected — it is pure compile-or-Z3 pass/fail and does not invoke the heuristic calculators.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.34x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 2.22x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.36)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.83x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.02)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.52x (Calor wins, large effect d=10.09)
  - EditPrecision: 1.39x (Calor wins, large effect d=4.91)
  - Correctness: 1.30x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.38)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Roslyn 5.3.0 upgrade** — Migration pipeline now uses Roslyn 5.3.0 (C# 14 support), enabling conversion of modern C# files using lambda parameter modifiers, `out` in lambda parameters, and other C# 13/14 features. Previously failed on files like Avalonia's `IFramebufferPlatformSurface.cs`.
- **`LanguageVersion.Preview` parse option** — The C# parser now accepts the broadest possible C# syntax, eliminating parse errors on cutting-edge C# code.

### Changed
- **Non-exhaustive match on `Option<T>` / `Result<T,E>` is now an error** (`Calor0500 NonExhaustiveMatch`, severity upgraded from Warning to Error for match statements). This is the TIER1C commitment from `docs/design/calor-direction.md` — exhaustive match on known sum types is mandatory syntax. The checker already identified these cases; this release makes them fail the build rather than pass with a warning. No repository `.calr` files were non-exhaustive on known sum types, so this upgrade is backward-compatible for existing code.
- **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp** upgraded from 4.8.0 to 5.3.0 across all projects

## [0.4.9] - 2026-04-21

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.34x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 2.22x (Calor wins)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.83x (Calor wins)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.52x (Calor wins)
  - EditPrecision: 1.39x (Calor wins)
  - Correctness: 1.30x (Calor wins)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Cross-assembly IL analysis** — Opt-in compile-time analysis that traces method calls through referenced .NET assemblies to discover effects not covered by manifests. Enabled via `<CalorEnableILAnalysis>true</CalorEnableILAnalysis>`. Handles async state machines, iterator methods, delegate creation (`ldftn`), and virtual dispatch. Three-state resolution ensures incomplete traces never report false purity. Benchmark: 2.8ms median for 8 call sites across 2 assemblies, 100% resolution rate on concrete call chains (6 resolved with effects, 2 pure, 0 incomplete). See [Cross-Assembly IL Analysis guide](/guides/il-analysis/).
- **IL analysis validation benchmark** — `bench/ILAnalysisBench/` measures assembly index construction, full analysis time, and per-call-site resolution results
- **28 IL analysis tests** covering assembly loading, call graph extraction, async/iterator state machines, virtual dispatch, delegate edges, method identity, soundness guarantees, and end-to-end integration
- **Cross-assembly IL analysis guide** — New website page documenting when to enable IL analysis, what it finds and doesn't, performance characteristics, and relationship to manifests
- **Cross-module effect propagation** — Multi-file Calor projects now enforce effect contracts across file boundaries. When a caller invokes a public function defined in another module (bare-name `§C{SaveOrder}` or qualified `§C{OrderService.SaveOrder}`), the caller's `§E{...}` must cover the callee's declared effects. Violations emit `Calor0410` with cross-module context; public functions without `§E` emit the new `Calor0417` warning.
- **Multi-file CLI** — `calor --input a.calr --input b.calr` compiles multiple files and runs the cross-module pass. Single-file usage is unchanged. `--output` is rejected when multiple inputs are passed (outputs are written alongside each input).
- **MSBuild cross-module enforcement** — `CompileCalor` task automatically runs the cross-module pass over every `.calr` file in the project. No new configuration required.
- **Persistent effect summary cache** — Each module's public function declarations, internal name table, and per-caller call-site listings are persisted in the build cache (`BuildState` format bumped to v2.0). Warm builds retain complete cross-module enforcement by combining fresh summaries (recompiled files) with cached summaries (incrementally-skipped files) — no re-parsing needed.
- **`CrossModuleEffectRegistry`** and **`CrossModuleEffectEnforcementPass`** — New enforcement components with AST-based and summary-based overloads. Declared-effects-as-contract model, one-hop-per-boundary enforcement, registry priority over supplemental manifests.
- **`ExternalCallCollector.CollectPerFunctionWithBareNames`** — New per-function mode retains bare-name call targets (previously dropped) for cross-module resolution.
- **34 new cross-module enforcement tests** — 24 unit tests (registry/pass behavior + null-guard + 500-module stress test) + 5 MSBuild integration tests + 3 CLI subprocess tests + 2 cache round-trip/migration tests.
- **[Cross-Module Effect Propagation guide](/guides/cross-module-effect-propagation/)** — Contract model, bare-name vs. qualified calls, ambiguity handling, warm-build semantics, CLI + MSBuild integration, troubleshooting.

### Changed
- **`--input` option** in the `calor` CLI now accepts multiple values (`Option<FileInfo[]>` with `ArgumentArity.OneOrMore`).
- **Build state cache format** bumped from `1.0` to `2.0` — existing caches are automatically invalidated on first build after upgrade.
- **Options hash includes `EffectKind` enum shape** — any future addition, removal, or rename of an `EffectKind` value automatically invalidates the build cache on the next build. Prevents stale summaries from silently dropping effects that a compiler upgrade re-categorized.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-04-20

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.34x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 2.22x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.36)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.83x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.02)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.52x (Calor wins, large effect d=10.09)

  - Correctness: 1.30x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.38)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Incremental compilation** — `CompileCalor` MSBuild task now owns all incremental logic with a two-level cache gate: (mtime, size) stat check then SHA256 content hash. Global invalidation on compiler DLL, options, effect manifest, or output directory changes. Compile failures delete prior `.g.cs` and skip caching to ensure correctness.
- **`calor effects suggest` CLI command** — Analyzes Calor source files and generates a `.calor-effects.suggested.json` manifest template for unresolved external calls. Supports `--json` for agent consumption, `--merge` for additive updates to existing manifests. Uses AST-based collection (not diagnostic parsing) with internal function filtering, variable type resolution, and call kind tagging.
- **Shared `ExternalCallCollector`** — Extracted from `InteropEffectCoverageCalculator`, extended to walk class methods and constructors (was functions only). Resolves variable types via `§NEW` initializer scanning.
- **Incremental build benchmark** — `bench/IncrementalBuildBench/` measures cold, warm (no changes), and warm (1 file changed) build times
- **Effect manifests .NET ecosystem guide** — New website page documenting ~170 covered types, resolution mechanics, custom manifest authoring, and CLI tools
- **Website changelog page** and **WhatsNewBanner** component for landing page release highlights
- 15 new suggest tests + BuildStateCache and CompileCalor integration tests

## [0.4.7] - 2026-04-20

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.34x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 2.22x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.36)

  - Correctness: 1.30x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.38)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Static analysis for class members** — The `--analyze` flag now examines methods, constructors, property accessors, operators, indexers, and event accessors (previously only top-level functions were analyzed)
- **Verification-gated reporting** — `--analyze` only reports proven findings by default (Z3-confirmed or constant analysis); use `--all-findings` for lower-confidence results
- **Taint hop-count tracking** — Taint analysis tracks propagation steps; single-hop parameter-to-sink flows filtered by default to reduce false positives
- **Bug pattern detection in class members** — Division by zero, null dereference, integer overflow, off-by-one, path traversal, command injection, and SQL injection detection now covers all class member bodies
- **ScopeRestorer RAII pattern** — Eliminates scope corruption risk from 14+ manual try/finally blocks in the Binder
- **Arity-aware overload resolution** — `Scope.LookupByArity` resolves correct overload by argument count, preventing wrong return types from flowing into Z3
- **Static context enforcement** — `this` expression not bindable in static methods and operators
- **Nested class scope isolation** — Inner classes don't inherit outer class fields
- **Constructor initializer binding** — `: base()`/`: this()` arguments visible to bug pattern checkers
- **BoundConditionalExpression** — Ternary expressions preserve all three branches for analysis (was returning only the true branch)
- **33 new unit tests** for class member binding, scope, overloads, dataflow, and end-to-end analysis
- **New `--all-findings` CLI flag** for showing all analysis findings including inconclusive results
- **New documentation page** (`/cli/static-analysis/`) documenting the analysis pipeline, finding types, and real-world results

### Fixed
- **False positive elimination** — Unhandled expression types (cast, array length, indexer, etc.) return opaque expressions instead of `BoundIntLiteral(0)`, eliminating the entire class of false division-by-zero reports
- **DEC literal misparse** — Decimal literals (`DEC:100`) now bind to `BoundFloatLiteral` instead of falling to zero-literal fallback
- **Assignment LHS not counted as use** — `x = 1` no longer reports `x` as "used before write" in dataflow analysis
- **Multi-statement sync blocks** — Lock bodies now preserved for analysis (was dropping all statements)
- **this.field shadowing** — `this.field` resolves from class scope, not method scope (prevents parameter shadowing field)
- **Throw-to-catch CFG edges** — Throw statements inside try blocks now flow to catch blocks instead of function exit
- **Using exception path** — Using statements modeled as try/finally with dispose on exception path
- **DeclaredEffects pass-through** — `VerificationAnalysisPass` now passes function effects to `TaintAnalysis` (was missing)

### Validated
- **47 open-source projects scanned** — 23 verified findings across 8 projects, 27 projects clean (zero findings), ~90% true positive rate
- **Real findings**: ILSpy null dereferences, FluentFTP path traversal, ASP.NET Core path traversal, Mapster unsafe unwraps, Avalonia nullable unwraps

  - Correctness: 1.30x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.38)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Effect system: .NET framework manifests** — Tier B effect manifests for 30+ common .NET framework interfaces (ILogger, DbContext, IConfiguration, HttpClient, ControllerBase, etc.) enabling the compiler to enforce correct effect declarations when Calor code calls framework types
- **Effect system: ecosystem library manifests** — Manifests for Serilog, Newtonsoft.Json, Dapper, MediatR, AutoMapper, FluentValidation, Polly
- **Effect system: BCL manifest expansion** — New manifests for System.Text.Json, Regex, Concurrent collections, Crypto types
- **Effect system: variable type resolution** — Enforcement pass resolves instance method calls via §NEW initializer tracking (e.g., §B{r} §NEW{Random} → r.Next resolves to rand)
- **Effect system: structured type info** — BoundCallExpression now carries ResolvedTypeName and ResolvedMethodName from the binder
- **Effect system: centralized type mapping** — MapShortTypeNameToFullName with 65+ type name mappings across BCL, framework, and ecosystem types
- 95 new enforcement tests (210 total)

### Fixed
- **Effect system: unified resolver** — Consolidated three parallel effect systems (BuiltInEffects, EffectsCatalog, EffectChecker.KnownEffects) into a single manifest-based resolver
