# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.34x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 2.22x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.36)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.83x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.02)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.52x (Calor wins, large effect d=10.09)
  - EditPrecision: 1.39x (Calor wins, large effect d=4.91)
  - Correctness: 1.30x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.38)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Roslyn 5.3.0 upgrade** — Migration pipeline now uses Roslyn 5.3.0 (C# 14 support), enabling conversion of modern C# files using lambda parameter modifiers, `out` in lambda parameters, and other C# 13/14 features. Previously failed on files like Avalonia's `IFramebufferPlatformSurface.cs`.
- **`LanguageVersion.Preview` parse option** — The C# parser now accepts the broadest possible C# syntax, eliminating parse errors on cutting-edge C# code.

### Changed
- **Non-exhaustive match on `Option<T>` / `Result<T,E>` is now an error** (`Calor0500 NonExhaustiveMatch`, severity upgraded from Warning to Error for match statements). This is the TIER1C commitment from `docs/design/calor-direction.md` — exhaustive match on known sum types is mandatory syntax. The checker already identified these cases; this release makes them fail the build rather than pass with a warning. No repository `.calr` files were non-exhaustive on known sum types, so this upgrade is backward-compatible for existing code.
- **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp** upgraded from 4.8.0 to 5.3.0 across all projects

## [0.4.9] - 2026-04-21

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.34x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 2.22x (Calor wins)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.83x (Calor wins)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.52x (Calor wins)
  - EditPrecision: 1.39x (Calor wins)
  - Correctness: 1.30x (Calor wins)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Cross-assembly IL analysis** — Opt-in compile-time analysis that traces method calls through referenced .NET assemblies to discover effects not covered by manifests. Enabled via `<CalorEnableILAnalysis>true</CalorEnableILAnalysis>`. Handles async state machines, iterator methods, delegate creation (`ldftn`), and virtual dispatch. Three-state resolution ensures incomplete traces never report false purity. Benchmark: 2.8ms median for 8 call sites across 2 assemblies, 100% resolution rate on concrete call chains (6 resolved with effects, 2 pure, 0 incomplete). See [Cross-Assembly IL Analysis guide](/guides/il-analysis/).
- **IL analysis validation benchmark** — `bench/ILAnalysisBench/` measures assembly index construction, full analysis time, and per-call-site resolution results
- **28 IL analysis tests** covering assembly loading, call graph extraction, async/iterator state machines, virtual dispatch, delegate edges, method identity, soundness guarantees, and end-to-end integration
- **Cross-assembly IL analysis guide** — New website page documenting when to enable IL analysis, what it finds and doesn't, performance characteristics, and relationship to manifests
- **Cross-module effect propagation** — Multi-file Calor projects now enforce effect contracts across file boundaries. When a caller invokes a public function defined in another module (bare-name `§C{SaveOrder}` or qualified `§C{OrderService.SaveOrder}`), the caller's `§E{...}` must cover the callee's declared effects. Violations emit `Calor0410` with cross-module context; public functions without `§E` emit the new `Calor0417` warning.
- **Multi-file CLI** — `calor --input a.calr --input b.calr` compiles multiple files and runs the cross-module pass. Single-file usage is unchanged. `--output` is rejected when multiple inputs are passed (outputs are written alongside each input).
- **MSBuild cross-module enforcement** — `CompileCalor` task automatically runs the cross-module pass over every `.calr` file in the project. No new configuration required.
- **Persistent effect summary cache** — Each module's public function declarations, internal name table, and per-caller call-site listings are persisted in the build cache (`BuildState` format bumped to v2.0). Warm builds retain complete cross-module enforcement by combining fresh summaries (recompiled files) with cached summaries (incrementally-skipped files) — no re-parsing needed.
- **`CrossModuleEffectRegistry`** and **`CrossModuleEffectEnforcementPass`** — New enforcement components with AST-based and summary-based overloads. Declared-effects-as-contract model, one-hop-per-boundary enforcement, registry priority over supplemental manifests.
- **`ExternalCallCollector.CollectPerFunctionWithBareNames`** — New per-function mode retains bare-name call targets (previously dropped) for cross-module resolution.
- **34 new cross-module enforcement tests** — 24 unit tests (registry/pass behavior + null-guard + 500-module stress test) + 5 MSBuild integration tests + 3 CLI subprocess tests + 2 cache round-trip/migration tests.
- **[Cross-Module Effect Propagation guide](/guides/cross-module-effect-propagation/)** — Contract model, bare-name vs. qualified calls, ambiguity handling, warm-build semantics, CLI + MSBuild integration, troubleshooting.

### Changed
- **`--input` option** in the `calor` CLI now accepts multiple values (`Option<FileInfo[]>` with `ArgumentArity.OneOrMore`).
- **Build state cache format** bumped from `1.0` to `2.0` — existing caches are automatically invalidated on first build after upgrade.
- **Options hash includes `EffectKind` enum shape** — any future addition, removal, or rename of an `EffectKind` value automatically invalidates the build cache on the next build. Prevents stale summaries from silently dropping effects that a compiler upgrade re-categorized.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-04-20

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.34x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 1
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 2.22x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.36)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.83x (Calor wins, large effect d=2.02)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.52x (Calor wins, large effect d=10.09)

- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Incremental compilation** — `CompileCalor` MSBuild task now owns all incremental logic with a two-level cache gate: (mtime, size) stat check then SHA256 content hash. Global invalidation on compiler DLL, options, effect manifest, or output directory changes. Compile failures delete prior `.g.cs` and skip caching to ensure correctness.
- **`calor effects suggest` CLI command** — Analyzes Calor source files and generates a `.calor-effects.suggested.json` manifest template for unresolved external calls. Supports `--json` for agent consumption, `--merge` for additive updates to existing manifests. Uses AST-based collection (not diagnostic parsing) with internal function filtering, variable type resolution, and call kind tagging.
- **Shared `ExternalCallCollector`** — Extracted from `InteropEffectCoverageCalculator`, extended to walk class methods and constructors (was functions only). Resolves variable types via `§NEW` initializer scanning.
- **Incremental build benchmark** — `bench/IncrementalBuildBench/` measures cold, warm (no changes), and warm (1 file changed) build times
- **Effect manifests .NET ecosystem guide** — New website page documenting ~170 covered types, resolution mechanics, custom manifest authoring, and CLI tools
- **Website changelog page** and **WhatsNewBanner** component for landing page release highlights
- 15 new suggest tests + BuildStateCache and CompileCalor integration tests

  - Correctness: 1.30x (Calor wins, large effect d=1.38)
- **Programs Tested**: 207

### Added
- **Static analysis for class members** — The `--analyze` flag now examines methods, constructors, property accessors, operators, indexers, and event accessors (previously only top-level functions were analyzed)
- **Verification-gated reporting** — `--analyze` only reports proven findings by default (Z3-confirmed or constant analysis); use `--all-findings` for lower-confidence results
- **Taint hop-count tracking** — Taint analysis tracks propagation steps; single-hop parameter-to-sink flows filtered by default to reduce false positives
- **Bug pattern detection in class members** — Division by zero, null dereference, integer overflow, off-by-one, path traversal, command injection, and SQL injection detection now covers all class member bodies
- **ScopeRestorer RAII pattern** — Eliminates scope corruption risk from 14+ manual try/finally blocks in the Binder
- **Arity-aware overload resolution** — `Scope.LookupByArity` resolves correct overload by argument count, preventing wrong return types from flowing into Z3
- **Static context enforcement** — `this` expression not bindable in static methods and operators
- **Nested class scope isolation** — Inner classes don't inherit outer class fields
- **Constructor initializer binding** — `: base()`/`: this()` arguments visible to bug pattern checkers
- **BoundConditionalExpression** — Ternary expressions preserve all three branches for analysis (was returning only the true branch)
- **33 new unit tests** for class member binding, scope, overloads, dataflow, and end-to-end analysis
- **New `--all-findings` CLI flag** for showing all analysis findings including inconclusive results
- **New documentation page** (`/cli/static-analysis/`) documenting the analysis pipeline, finding types, and real-world results

### Fixed
- **False positive elimination** — Unhandled expression types (cast, array length, indexer, etc.) return opaque expressions instead of `BoundIntLiteral(0)`, eliminating the entire class of false division-by-zero reports
- **DEC literal misparse** — Decimal literals (`DEC:100`) now bind to `BoundFloatLiteral` instead of falling to zero-literal fallback
- **Assignment LHS not counted as use** — `x = 1` no longer reports `x` as "used before write" in dataflow analysis
- **Multi-statement sync blocks** — Lock bodies now preserved for analysis (was dropping all statements)
- **this.field shadowing** — `this.field` resolves from class scope, not method scope (prevents parameter shadowing field)
- **Throw-to-catch CFG edges** — Throw statements inside try blocks now flow to catch blocks instead of function exit
- **Using exception path** — Using statements modeled as try/finally with dispose on exception path
- **DeclaredEffects pass-through** — `VerificationAnalysisPass` now passes function effects to `TaintAnalysis` (was missing)

### Validated
- **47 open-source projects scanned** — 23 verified findings across 8 projects, 27 projects clean (zero findings), ~90% true positive rate
- **Real findings**: ILSpy null dereferences, FluentFTP path traversal, ASP.NET Core path traversal, Mapster unsafe unwraps, Avalonia nullable unwraps

### Added
- **Effect system: .NET framework manifests** — Tier B effect manifests for 30+ common .NET framework interfaces (ILogger, DbContext, IConfiguration, HttpClient, ControllerBase, etc.) enabling the compiler to enforce correct effect declarations when Calor code calls framework types
- **Effect system: ecosystem library manifests** — Manifests for Serilog, Newtonsoft.Json, Dapper, MediatR, AutoMapper, FluentValidation, Polly
- **Effect system: BCL manifest expansion** — New manifests for System.Text.Json, Regex, Concurrent collections, Crypto types

- **EffectCodes.ToCompact: missing mappings** — Added environment_read→env:r, database_write→db:w, heap_write→mut and other internal-to-surface code conversions
- **Enforcement: collection mutations** — Added CollectionPushNode, DictionaryPutNode, CollectionRemoveNode, etc. to the enforcement pass (→ mut effect)
- **Converter: effect declaration format** — Fixed converter emitting internal values (environment_read) instead of surface codes (env:r) in §E declarations

### Removed
- `BuiltInEffects.cs` — ~204 hardcoded entries migrated to manifest JSON files
- `EffectsCatalog.cs` — Intermediate layer removed; EffectResolver handles all resolution
- `EffectChecker` class — Legacy checker replaced by EffectEnforcementPass; shared types moved to EffectTypes.cs

- **UTF-8 string literals** — Round-trip support for `"hello"u8` via `IsUtf8` property on `StringLiteralNode`, with lexer/parser/emitter changes

### Fixed
- **Slice position correctness** — `[var first, .., var last]` now correctly preserves the slice position instead of always appending at end; bare `..` emits without spurious `var _` binding
- **Unknown feature default** — `FeatureSupport.GetSupportLevel` now returns `NotSupported` for unregistered features, preventing silent suppression of blockers in `MigrationAnalyzer`
- **PostConversionFixer CRLF handling** — Orphaned closing tag regex now handles Windows `\r\n` line endings correctly

- **Named argument round-trip** — Named arguments in converter output now use correct `name: value` syntax that parses back cleanly
- **Unicode escape sequences** — `\Uxxxxxxxx` 8-digit Unicode escapes now handled correctly in string literals
- **Ternary decomposition** — Ternary expressions (`a ? b : c`) now decompose to `§IF` expression form instead of statement form, fixing 26+ Calor0104 errors across real-world codebases
- **Doc comment carriage return leaks** — `\r` characters stripped from XML doc comments during conversion, preventing broken `//` comment prefixes
- **§ markers in Lisp expressions** — Binary/unary operations with §-containing operands (calls, ternaries) now hoist to temp vars, preventing Calor0114 parse errors inside `(op arg1 arg2)` expressions
- **Empty §ASSIGN for collections** — Collection creation (List, Dict, Set, Array) as assignment RHS now emits the collection block with the target name directly, instead of empty `§ASSIGN` statements

### Converter Quality Improvements

- **Operator precedence** — Fixed parenthesization in complex expressions during conversion
- **Target-typed new** — `new()` infers type from context instead of emitting `NEW{object}`
- **MCP memory pressure** — Wait-and-retry with backoff instead of immediate rejection; concurrency scaled with CPU count
- **Feature discoverability** — MCP tool output now includes feature support status and workarounds inline

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-07

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 0.80x (C# leads overall)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 4, C# wins 4
- **Highlights**:
  - ErrorDetection: 1.55x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - Comprehension: 1.49x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.49x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - EditPrecision: 1.36x (Calor wins, large effect)
- **Programs Tested**: 28

### Fixed
- Benchmark calculators now use correct curly brace syntax `{` for Calor patterns instead of square brackets `[`
- This fix enables proper detection of Calor language constructs in RefactoringStability, Comprehension, ErrorDetection, and EditPrecision metrics
